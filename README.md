I'm Evan, currently a student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Mechatronics Engineering. Technology has always fascinated me, and I'm continually eager to broaden my knowledge in this domain. Mechanical design, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation captivate my interest.

During my high school years, I gained practical experience in web design while creating and managing a website for a middle school Model United Nations conference hosted by my high school. Moreover, I pursued a research project involving the development of an image classification model using TensorFlow and a custom database.
