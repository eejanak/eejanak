My name is Evan and I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo studying Mechatronics Engineering.

I have had an interest in technology throughout my life and always look for new things to learn about. I’m interested in mechanical design, artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation.

During high school I had experience with web design through the creation and management of a website for a middle school Model United Nations conference. I also completed a research project to create an image classification model using Tensorflow and a self-created database.
